      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">You will have to pay the full costs of your care</h1>
      <p class="govuk-body-l">Based on your answers, you would have to cover the costs of care yourself.</p>
      <div class="govuk-inset-text">An exception to this is if you have complex health needs or you need primary health care, rather than social care. You may be eligible for NHS funded care.</div>
      <p class="govuk-body">We can help you find suitable service providers and make arrangements if you wish, but you are free to make any arrangements you choose and pay the providers directly.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When your savings and investments reduce to less than £23,250 you may qualify for financial support.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">To apply for financial support you will need to contact the Adult Services Access Team to request a <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Care Assessment</a>, and complete a <a class="govuk-link" href="#">Financial Assessment</a> form. We recommend you apply slightly before your capital falls below £23,250 to allow time for your application to be processed.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you give away large sums of your savings to friends or relatives, or transfer your assets (e.g. your property) to put yourself in a more favourable position to get local authority funding for your care and support services, the local authority may be able to financially assess you as if you still have the savings or assets.
